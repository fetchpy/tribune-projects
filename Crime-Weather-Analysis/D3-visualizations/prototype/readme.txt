to generate temp_reg_analysis.csv file, go back to Crime_Weather_Report-Analysis to cell 20. Output the file in .csv
then run manually a script to select the subset of crimes you are interested in analyzing.

NOTE:
- Headers to the .csv file for the plotting shouldn't have any space
- The above also applies to data entries (e.g., CRIMINAL DAMAGE should be CRIMINAL_DAMAGE)
